# Week6ChallengeUpdated

You client is a car dealership. Their competitor across the street has a site that looks like this: http://week6challenge-v1.herokuapp.com/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.

They want a site that will give them the same capabilities: the ability to add, update, delete and list cars for sale; the ability to put those cars in categories and show the cars in a category.

- It can't look EXACTLY like that site, that's how you get sued.
- Don't over-complicate it. Simplicity is best.
- Skip any features you don't know how to implement. Do not waste your time trying to figure out something new. If you have time then work on that item after you have completed everything else.
- The client doesn't care about the code - only the functionality and the output
- Use the H2 database. Do not use MySQL. It doesn't work on Heroku
